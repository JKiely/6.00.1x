6.00.1x
=======

Some of the programs I created as part of the edX [6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0) course.
Not all of the code was written by me, but the helper code provided for me should be labeled.

The course can be found at edX [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0) and at MIT open courseware [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/)

My work on the second part of the course can be found [here](https://github.com/JKiely/6.00.2x)
